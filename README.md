### Spec:

### Running the project locally
#### *Requirements: Node, Npm, Angular CLI*
#### **Instructions**:

- Open a terminal
- Execute `git clone https://github.com/TheWildebeest/ia.git` to make a copy of the repository locally.
- Execute `ls` to confirm the folder 'data-visualisation' exists.
- Execute `cd ia` to move into the project directory.
- Execute `npm install` to install all project dependencies.
- Once finished, use the angular command `ng serve` to boot up a local dev server.

#### **Packages used**:
- **D3** to render chart data
- **Bootstrap** for quick and easy UI setup

#### **Things I would have done if I'd had more time**:
- **Finish the chart**:
  - add axis labels
  - add some nicer styling
  - use nicer fonts
  - add entry animation on the graph
  - add a loading placeholder for the graph to prevent layout jank
- **Add NGRX**:
  - Create a store
  - Dispatch a 'Dashboard loaded' event
  - Add an effect to listen to actions of type 'Dashboard loaded' and fetch the dashboard data
  - DataService could then be moved to store and any data processing moved into reducer or done in the effect
